# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends
# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
During this project, I thoroughly reviewed the kickstarter dataset to inform Louise on play success through visualizations as she makes her decision to launch her own campaign.

### Purpose
Louise requested information on past plays through the kickstarter data in which I combed through to better understand outcomes based on launch dates and funding goals using charts and tables. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
To visualize and better predict launch success based on time of year, I created a PivotTable to breakdown the categories of launch outcomes in each month over the span of the year. From there, I created a line chart to take it a step further in visualizing the trends happening throughout the year based on launch date. This clearly defined the previous success of launches and made it easier to identify which months were more successful than others. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
To visualize and better predict outcomes based on goals, I created a table pulling various details from my dataset to compare success-based goals ranging from <1000 to >50000. Breaking down success by goal ranges led to gaining percentages and clearly identifying goals that were less likely to be successful. Using this table, I created a line chart to visualize trends and better understand goal ranges.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
During the process of creating the outcomes based on goals chart, I ran into an error with pulling data from my ‘kickstarter’ sheet which resulted in my chart being incorrect. I double checked my countifs formula and manually filtered the kickstarter sheet to see if there could be an error I was overlooking. I ultimately had to go back to the original sheet and create a duplicate of the kickstarter page, titled “kickstart” to pull from for the Outcomes Based on Goals Chart since I couldn’t spot the error in the original sheet and didn’t want to proceed with inaccurate data.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
My conclusion from the Outcomes based on Launch Date analysis is that success is likely in May or June based on previous launches. Success decreases toward the end of the year in the winter months.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
My conclusion from the Outcomes based on Goals analysis is that the most successful goal range is <5000. It was also interesting to note that there was no record of a play being canceled in the past. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
A limitation that I noticed from the dataset is that the subcategory we were most interested in was ‘plays’. From there, we weren’t able to define the play’s theme other than the blurb which was too lengthy. 


- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
A table or graph based upon geographic location would be insightful to determine success and popularity based on country or even region as I’m sure some regions favor plays over others.
